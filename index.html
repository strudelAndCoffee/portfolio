        <h2 class="title">About Stephen</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            A native Austinite, having lived here my whole life, I started my
            first job as many do: bagging groceries at the Texas super-market
            staple H-E-B as soon as I turned 16. Eventually moving up to
            cashier, I remained a dedicated employee for 7 years.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After finishing my Associates Degree in French at Austin Community
            College, I began studying audio engineering and recording, and
            switched jobs from groceries to pouring soups and making smoothies
            at another Austin staple, The Soup Peddler, where I have remained a
            dedicated employee going on 7 years strong...
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I have also found work and creative outlets as a musician, playing
            in bands and in the pit for music theater productions around town.
            Music has and always will be one of my biggest passions, but as a
            means of income, I have grown weary of the financial uncertainty and
            level of schmoozing necessary to sustain work opportunity as a
            self-employed musician, especially in the changing landscape of
            Austin.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This is where I now look to a new craft to apply my self-motivated
            skills towards. One which <> passion to incorporate into my life -
            one that I can commit to 100%, and one with which to better support
            myself and my future family. Music will always be a pasion, but I
            can be just as devoted in time, ambition, and creativity towards a
            craft that is as intellectually stimulating and far-reaching (and
            highly marketable) as web development.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I hope that the work I have put on display here may demonstrate my
            potential for working in the diverse field of web development and
            programming.
