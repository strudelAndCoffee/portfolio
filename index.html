          <h2 class="title">ABOUT STEPHEN</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              A native Austinite, having lived here my whole life, I started my
              first job at 16 as many do: bagging groceries at the Texas
              super-market staple H-E-B. Eventually moving up to cashier, I
              remained a dedicated employee for 7 years.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After finishing my Associate Degree in French at Austin Community
              College, I began studying audio engineering and recording, and
              switched jobs from groceries to food service, working at another
              Austin staple, The Soup Peddler, where I have earned a living
              while devoting most of my free time to music. I actively maintain
              work with recording, mixing, and live sound projects locally, both
              self-sustained and collaborative, ranging from professional to
              just for fun.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I have also found work and creative outlets as a musician, playing
              in bands at local venues, and in the pit for music theater and
              cabaret productions around town. Music has and always will be one
              of my biggest passions, but as a means of income, I have learned
              through experience that the type of life necessary to sustain work
              as a self-employed instrumentalist is one not quite suited for me,
              especially in the changing landscape of Austin. I hope to continue
              my involvement in projects and productions when opportunities
              arise, but I feel I do not have what it takes to weather the 
              uncertainty that comes from pursuing music as a career...
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              This is where I now look to a new craft to apply my self-motivated
              skills and experience; a new passion to incorporate into my life -
              a craft which I am committed to learning and mastering, and by
              which I may better support myself and my future family. Music will
              always be a pasion, but I can be just as devoted in time,
              ambition, and creativity in a domain that is as intellectually
              stimulating and impactful.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I hope that the work I have put on display here may demonstrate my
              potential for working in the diverse field of web development and
              programming. I believe that behind the logic and reason, there is
              art; and behind the realisation of creativity, there is
              technology; and all is required for the inovation from which the
              world may beneift. Thank you for your consideration!
