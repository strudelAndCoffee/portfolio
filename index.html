        <h2 class="title">About Stephen</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            A native Austinite, having lived here my whole life, I started my
            first job at 16 as many do: bagging groceries at the Texas
            super-market staple H-E-B. Eventually moving up to cashier, I
            remained a dedicated employee for 7 years.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After finishing my Associates Degree in French at Austin Community
            College, I began studying audio engineering and recording, and
            switched jobs from groceries to food service, working at another
            Austin staple, The Soup Peddler, where I have been a valued employee
            for almost 7 years...
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I have also found work and creative outlets as a musician, playing
            in bands at local venues and abroad, and in the pit for music
            theater and cabaret productions around town. Music has and always
            will be one of my biggest passions, but as a means of income, I have
            grown weary of the financial uncertainty and obligatory schmoozing
            necessary to sustain work opportunity as a self-employed
            instrumentalist, especially in the changing landscape of Austin.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This is where I now look to a new craft to apply my self-motivated
            skills and experience; a new passion to incorporate into my life -
            one that I can commit to 100%, and one with which to better support
            myself and my future family. Music will always be a pasion, but I
            can be just as devoted in time, ambition, and creativity towards a
            craft as intellectually stimulating and impactful.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I hope that the work I have put on display here may demonstrate my
            potential for working in the diverse field of web development and
            programming. Thank you for your consideration!
