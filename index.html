        <h2 class="title">About</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            I was born in Austin, Texas, and I have lived here my whole life.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            My first job was bagging groceries at the Texas staple H-E-B. I
            started when I was 16, and eventually moved up to cashier, remaining
            a faithful employee for 7 years.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After finishing my Associates Degree in French at Austin Community
            College, I took an opportunity to switch jobs and work for another
            Austin staple, The Soup Peddler, first running home deliveries, then
            store commisary deliveries, finally working behind the counter as
            cashier and food prep at the original brick and morter. I am still
            working for the company, going on 7 years strong...
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I have also found work and creative outlets as a musician, playing
            in bands and in the pit for music theater productions around town.
            Music has and will always be one of my biggest passions, but as a
            means of income, I have found that I am not cut out for the
            lifestyle, with the necessary hustle and financial uncertainty that
            comes with it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            For this reason, I have decided to welcome change and find a new
            passion to incorporate into my life - one that I can commit 100% to,
            and one with which to better support myself and my future family. I
            will always love music, and will continue to play as much as I can,
            but I can be just as devoted in time, ambition, and creativity
            towards a craft that is intellectually stimulating and highly
            marketable!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Thus begins my journey toward this new horizon, or as I like to
            think about it, in terms of another loved pastime of mine, Dungeons
            & Dragons: to level up! Level up my character, my life, my future
            prospects.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I hope that the work I have put on display here may demonstrate my
            potential for working in the diverse field of web development and
            programming.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Commitment, resilience, self-improvement, and the magic of
            collaboration are the core concepts that drive me to create the next
            <em>new</em>, the next <em>useful</em>, and in any way I can, the
            next <em>beneficial</em> for the <strong><em>world</em></strong
            >.
